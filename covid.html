1.  Wash your hands frequently and catch coughs and sneezes in a tissue
</h3></b>

<P style="color:SlateBlue;"> A simple and effective way to protect yourself and others from coronavirus is by making sure you wash your hands frequently with soap and water, or a hand sanitiser if you are out and about. It’s particularly important to wash your hands once you get home or arrive at work or before you prepare or eat food.
</P>

2) Be prepared to self-isolate
</h3>
<p style="color:SlateBlue;">This means staying indoors and avoiding contact with other people for seven days after the onset of symptoms (new, continuous cough and/or high temperature). People can return to normal activity after seven days if they do not have a temperature and feel like they are improving.

3) Plan ahead based on your situation
</h3>
<p style="color:SlateBlue;">
There are a number of ways to slow down an infectious disease outbreak. Well-established tactics include self-isolation as mentioned above, as well as measures sometimes referred to as “social distancing.”

One example of social distancing could be encouraging more working from home for instance, or another option could involve urging people to continue to go to work or school as usual, but reduce social activity or non-essential travel.

Looking ahead, what preparations could you put in place to help you self-isolate if you needed to?

4) Use health services wisely.
</h3>
<p style="color:SlateBlue;">
Now that COVID-19 is considered to be spreading in the community this could mean the NHS is busier than usual so it’s important to think carefully about the NHS services you use.

If you start to experience symptoms and believe you could have coronavirus, do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital as you could pass the infection to others. 
Visit nearest government hospitals or dispensaries.

5)Stay up to date using trusted sources of information

Since COVID-19 began to spread quickly in China, it has been a major global news story and with this level of media and public interest it’s inevitable that myths, misinformation and rumours will be shared online.
